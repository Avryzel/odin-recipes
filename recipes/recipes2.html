        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Rendang is a rich and flavorful Indonesian dish made from slow-cooked beef simmered in coconut milk and a mixture of aromatic spices. The cooking process, which can take several hours, allows the meat to become tender and the sauce to thicken and caramelize, resulting in a dark, intense, and complex flavor. Traditionally served at festive occasions and celebrations, rendang is beloved for its deep, savory taste and its ability to be preserved for a long time without refrigeration.</p>

            <h1>How To Make</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Blend the shallots, garlic, ginger, galangal, turmeric, red chilies, and candlenuts into a smooth paste. You may need to add a little water to help the blending process.</li><br>
                <li>In a large pot, heat some oil over medium heat. Add the spice paste and cook until fragrant and the oil starts to separate from the paste, about 5-10 minutes.</li><br>
                <li>Add the beef cubes to the pot and cook until the beef is browned on all sides.</li><br>
                <li>Pour in the coconut milk and water. Add the kaffir lime leaves, turmeric leaves, lemongrass, and galangal. Stir well to combine.</li><br>
                <li>ring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer uncovered. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Cook until the beef is tender and the sauce has thickened and darkened, about 2-3 hours.</li><br>
                <li>Add the tamarind paste, sugar, and salt to taste. Continue to cook until the oil separates from the sauce, and the beef is tender and caramelized.</li><br>
                <li>Remove the kaffir lime leaves, turmeric leaves, lemongrass, and galangal. Serve the rendang with steamed rice.</li><br>
